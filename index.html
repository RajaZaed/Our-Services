                    <h3>Kim's Website</h3>
                    

                    <p>For Kim's website, I developed a user-friendly and responsive platform to streamline the application process. I created a dynamic <strong>homepage</strong> that provides essential information clearly and attractively. The site features an integrated <strong>online application system</strong>, allowing students to apply for both <strong>diploma</strong> and <strong>BS programs</strong> directly through the website. Additionally, I built a custom <strong>online form</strong> where students can easily submit their information, reducing paperwork. The website is fully <strong>responsive</strong>, ensuring it works smoothly across all devices, and the <strong>user-friendly interface</strong> makes navigation simple for applicants. The use of modern technologies ensures fast performance, making it easy for students to apply anytime and from any device.</p>

                    <h3>Sundown Studio Clone Website</h3>
                    <p>For this project, I created a clone of the popular Sundown Studio website to showcase my skills in web development. The website features a modern and sleek design, with an easy-to-use interface for users. I implemented an <strong>online purchase system</strong> that allows visitors to select and buy a wide range of products. Additionally, I included a <strong>product selection tool</strong> where users can browse through different options, choose their preferences, and add items to their cart. The site is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth shopping experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This clone not only replicates the design and functionality of Sundown Studio but also enhances the user experience by offering a seamless, efficient online shopping platform.</p>
